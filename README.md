Certainly! Here’s a refined paragraph version:

I developed a comprehensive dashboard for a telecommunications company, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) to track and analyze customer trends. The dashboard includes metrics such as total customers, new customers, churned customers, and churn rate, displayed both in absolute numbers and percentages. I incorporated deep analysis features by applying filters like gender, state, age group, and churn categories (e.g., service provider attitude, better offers from competitors, and pricing concerns). This allows for more granular insights into customer behavior and churn drivers. The dashboard is designed to empower stakeholders with real-time data, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning to improve customer retention and business performance.
